// This file defines the load order for all modules within the state subdirectory. EVERYTHING from this
// subdirectory should be imported and exported from here. If we stick to this, fixing circular dependency
// issues just becomes a matter of reordering the exports below until things are defined in the correct order.
// For example "./reducers/eventsState" is imported AFTER "./actions/routing", because it needs the
// `routerPageChange` action creator.
//
// See https://medium.com/visual-development/how-to-fix-nasty-circular-dependency-issues-once-and-for-all-in-javascript-typescript-a04c987cf0de
// for a more detailed explanation of the process.
